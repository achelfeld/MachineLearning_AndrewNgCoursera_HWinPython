# MachineLearning_AndrewNgCoursera_HWinPython

I audited the Machine Learning course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. I first did the homework in Octave/Matlab, as required by the course. 
I then translated most of the solutions to Python. My solutions using both "from scratch" machine learning algorithms
and scikit-learn algorithms are posted here. Although this work is my own, I did borrow from some of the Octave/Matlab code already created
as part of the homework for this course. 
The Python solutions are done in Jupyter notebooks.

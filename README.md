# MachineLearning_AndrewNgCoursera_HWinPython

I audited the Machine Learning course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. I first did the homework in Octave/Matlab, as this was the program used by the course. 
I then translated most of the solutions to Python. My solutions include some "from scratch" machine learning algorithms
and some scikit-learn algorithms. Although this work is my own, I did borrow from some of the Octave/Matlab code already created
as part of the homework for this course. 
The Python solutions are done in Jupyter notebooks. 
I ran some tests of how various parameters (i.e., learning rate, regularization, etc) impact the results (i.e., accuracy, bias/variance tradeoff).

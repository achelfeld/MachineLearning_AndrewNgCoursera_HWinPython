Homework 7: A k-means clustering problem was solved using a "from scratch" algorithm and using the built-in scikit-learn algorithm. The final centroids were plotted for different numbers of initializations. K-means clustering was also run on an image to reduce the number of colors. Finally, principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to reduce a 2D problem to a 1D problem: the 1D projection is shown. Finally, PCA was used to reduce the resolution of an image.

Homework 7: A k-means clustering problem was solved using both a "from scratch" algorithm and using the built-in scikit-learn algorithm. For the scikit-learn solution, different numbers of centroid initializations were tested to show how the algorithm could "get stuck" if only conducted a few times: the final centroids were plotted for different numbers of initializations. 
K-means clustering was also run on an image to reduce the number of colors. 
A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to reduce a 2D problem to a 1D problem: the 1D projection is shown. Finally, PCA was used to reduce the resolution of an image.

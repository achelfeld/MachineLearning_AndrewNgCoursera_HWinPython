Homework 7: In part 1, a classification problem was solved using the support vector machine (SVM) scikit-learn algorithm. The algorithm was run with different regularization parameters C and several decision boundaries were plotted for different C values. In parts 2 and 3, two other classification problems were solved using the SVM algorithm.
